# EminemAI

Creates Eminem style lyrics and converts them to audio in the voice of Eminem

## Example output produced (Warning: NSFW!):

```
She loves me!
Can you hear me? I aint got time
I need you to shut your mouth
Shut up, bitch!
You know how many times I gotta say a word
And I just say it once
And thats all you gots to see
Yo, this is what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, micsll get slain
Like they were strangled with bicycle chains
Youâ€™re gonna have to come identify the remains
Wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a bread tie
Cant get a fuckin word in edgewise
Success overnight like a red-eye
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside of Dallas
In a laser tag vest and a racin jacket
```
